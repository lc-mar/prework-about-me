      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'd say call me Lauren but most people don't. Laur, LC, Marcinek, Sparkles, Paw Paw, Karaoke QUEEN are some of my aliases. And I actually do like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The town so nice they named it twice... Paw Paw, MI. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>What isn't my favorite hobby? I am a jack of all trades but a master of very few. I love to spend time with my friends, family, and most importantly my cats. You can usually find me trying something new (currently into weaving and tie dying???) or out exploring the world... or on my couch watching Criminal Minds.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Stay at home cat mom</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Beer City USA!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was actually working on getting my MA in English and decided to do a complete 180 in regards to my career path. I've always been interested in coding but never took the first step (besides teaching myself HTML when I made my tumblr back in the day...), so here I am!    </p>
